Good morning

day1(21-04-2020):
===============
python oops:
    --> class
    --> object
    --> constructors
    --> inheritance

class:
    it is collection of variables and methods
    function: is a coolection statements
    method: if function is existed inside the class then will call that is a method.
    syntax:
        class class_name:
            list of vars
            list of methods

Object:
    it is a instance of a class
    syntax:

        obj_name = class_name

constructors:
    the main advantage of constructor is without using object we will call function
    
    class className:

        def __init__(self):# it is cinstructor
        def __init__(self,a,b)
        def __init__(a,b,self)

Package and Module:
    Package(Folder):
        it is a collection of modules
    Module:
        - that is .py file
        - it is a collection of functions or classes
        - for accesing modules we are using import keyword 
        - for accessing modules we have few different ways
            - import myModule
            - from myModule import Calsi
            - from myModule.Calsi import add
            - from myModule.Calsi import *
task1:
=====
    --->you have to create a class i.e UserInfo('abdul')
    ---> setAddrs(empId,mailid,cmpName)
    ---> showDetails()
            - you have to print name,empid,mailid and cmpname of the user

Inheritance:
==========
    --> we are trying to inherting something from parent calss to child class
    --> general format is class childClass(parentClass):
    --> single level inheritance
        -- there is only one parrnt calss and pny one child class
    --> multilevel
        -- > one or more parents and one or more childs
    --> mutiple
        --> more than one parent and one child
    --> hibrid etc
        --- it is combination of all inhertance
Polymorphism:
=============
